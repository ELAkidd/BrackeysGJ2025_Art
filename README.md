# BrackeysGJ2025_Art
Jimmy - you can put all art here. I have included a sample art on where you can put your work.

Ask GPT about anything on this. I also recommend you getting a Github Desktop, so you don't need to use command line.

In case you are curious why we use git instead of like google drive - this is because I will put this git repo under my game project folder, so any modifications will automatically show up in game when you update anything!
